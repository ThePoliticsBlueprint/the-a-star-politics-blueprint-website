            Has the USA's 'layer-cake' system been completely replaced by a 'marble-cake' of overreaching federal power?

            <p>
                The core debate in A-Level Politics is whether federalism, as the Founding Fathers intended, still exists in the US. Arguments that it doesn't are compelling. The 20th century saw a dramatic expansion of federal power, driven by events like the Great Depression and the Civil Rights movement, which centralized authority in Washington. The federal government now spends far more on policy areas like healthcare and social welfare than states, blurring the traditional lines of authority. This has led many to conclude that states are now little more than administrative units for the federal government, a view supported by the fact that states receive a quarter of their income in the form of federal grants.

                <li>
                    <strong>Arguments FOR the demise of federalism:</strong> The Affordable Care Act (2010), also known as Obamacare, required states to expand their Medicaid programs or lose all federal Medicaid funding, which was seen as a major overreach of federal power. This demonstrates the federal government using financial leverage to force states to comply with its will.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Arguments AGAINST the demise of federalism:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic response showed that states still have significant autonomy, with governors exercising their powers to issue lockdowns and mask mandates. Red states like Texas ended their mandates a year before blue states like California. This demonstrates that states can, and do, chart their own course, even on matters of national public health.
